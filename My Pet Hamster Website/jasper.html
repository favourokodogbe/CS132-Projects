            <h3>Fun facts about Jasper</h3>
            <p>
                Jasper lived in Page House at Caltech! He enjoys the 
                housing provided at Caltech, unlike many people. 
            </p>

            <p>
                His favorite hobby is running <em>FAST</em> and making tunnels
                in his home.
            </p>

            <p>
                His favorite foods are oranges, bread, apples, and cereal.
                He also eats rice, chicken, pasta, and other human food.
            </p>

            <p>
                While most hamsters sleep buried in their bedding, Jasper
                loves to sleep on his wheel with food in his mouth. He sleeps
                when everyone is in class and is very active at night.
