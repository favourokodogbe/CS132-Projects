                <h2>Please read the facts below:</h2>
                <p>
                    Also known as the golden or teddy-bear hamster, Syrian 
                    hamsters are 5 to 7 inches long, and weigh around 
                    4 to 8oz. They vary in color and coat length. Their 
                    scientific name is <em>Mesocricetus auratus</em>. 
                    They vary in size and color. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Syrian hamsters are solitary animals and do not tolerate company.
                    However, once they are comfortable in their environment, they 
                    enjoy interaction with humans, and become curious, friendly, 
                    affectionate pets. They are great pets to have as they are 
                    low maintenance, which could be helpful if you have a busy schedule.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A Syrian hamster cost aroud $10. To cater to the hamster's 
                    need of food and new bedding every two weeks, it can cost around 
                    $10 a month. However, hamsters need an exercise ball, toys, a cage,
                    wheel, and other essentials to be well-tended and not get bored. 
                    These are usually a one-time cost and depending on the size of 
                    the hamster, this could be around $200-300. The cage is the 
                    most expensive essentials a hamster needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A Syrian hamster can live to 2 years in your home, which makes 
                    getting attached to them emotionally more difficult. However,     
                    this can be stretched to 3 to 4 years if the hamster remains healthy
                    and is well taken care of. Illness, stress, unhealthy or toxic food, and
                    infections can play a major role in the life expectancy of the hamster.
