Hello! My name is Favour Okodogbe and I am a senior at Caltech studying Computer Science and Information and Data 
Science. I have a passion for Web Development and Data Science with experience in both from classes and internships.
Please reach out to me at feokodogbe4@gmail.com if you have any questions!

More information on my current projects:

I have four creative web development projects that I have made. Creative projects #4 and #5 require node modules to be
downloaded to view the material on local host 8000. They are full stack websites. Most of my websites use HTML and CSS while the more complex ones
include Node.js and JSON files to create the APIs used for the website.

My database project includes an admit and client side dog adoption service database and it was creating using SQL and Python.
